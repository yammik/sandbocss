# SandboCSS 
##### ('sandbox' hahahhahaha get it)
A CSS cheatsheet and sandbox in one app. ~~A cheatbox, if you will...wait no, sandsheet? Seatshox?~~
Most available CSS properties you can apply to an HTML element are displayed on the left panel, organized alphabetically.
CSS is a pain sometimes. Maybe by playing around with this sandbox you will get a better understanding of what certain properties do. :>
